# WorkScheduler

This Project built out of HTML, CSS and JavaScript works as a work day scheduler to help organize your day. As a user, when I open the planner, I want the date displayed at the top and time blocks for each hour of the work day. Each block should be color coded for past, prsent or future. The user will be able to enter events into each time block and save them their through local storage.
